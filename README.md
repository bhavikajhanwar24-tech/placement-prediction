In this project, a Placement Prediction System was developed using machine learning techniques to predict whether a student would get placed based on academic and aptitude-related features such as CGPA and IQ.
Multiple classification algorithms including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVC), KNN, Decision tree, Logistic Regression and Random Forest were implemented and evaluated.

Among all the models, the Random Forest Classifier delivered the best performance with a test accuracy of 95% and a cross-validation accuracy of 93.9%, indicating strong generalization and minimal overfitting.
Hyperparameter tuning was performed to improve model stability and performance.

The final trained model was deployed using Flask, providing a simple web interface by Pycharm where users can input values and receive real-time placement predictions. 
The website (built using Flask and developed in PyCharm) looks like this 👇
